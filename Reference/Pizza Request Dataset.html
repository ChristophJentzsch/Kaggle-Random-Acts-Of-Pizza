---- DATA DESCRIPTION AND FORMAT ----

- This dataset includes 5671 requests collected from the Reddit community &quot;Random Acts of Pizza&quot; (<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/">http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/</a>) between December 8, 2010 and September 29, 2013 (retrieved on September 30, 2013).
All requests ask for the same thing: a free pizza. The outcome of each request --- whether its author received a pizza or not --- is known.
Meta-data includes information such as: time of the request, activity of the requester, community-age of the requester, etc.  

- Each entry in pizza_request_dataset.json corresponds to one request (the first and only request by the requester on RAOP).

- For each request, the following fields are included:

  &quot;giver_username_if_known&quot;: Reddit username of giver if known, i.e. the person satisfying the request (&quot;N/A&quot; otherwise).

  &quot;in_test_set&quot;: Boolean indicating whether this request was part of our test set.

  &quot;request_text&quot;: Full text of the request.

  &quot;request_text_edit_aware&quot;: Edit aware version of &quot;request_text&quot;. We use a set of rules to strip edited comments indicating the success of the request such as &quot;EDIT: Thanks /u/foo, the pizza was delicous&quot;. 

  &quot;request_title&quot;: Title of the request.

  &quot;requester_account_age_in_days_at_request&quot;: Account age of requester in days at time of request.

  &quot;requester_account_age_in_days_at_retrieval&quot;: Account age of requester in days at time of retrieval.

  &quot;requester_days_since_first_post_on_raop_at_request&quot;: Number of days between requesters first post on RAOP and this request (zero if requester has never posted before on RAOP). 

  &quot;requester_days_since_first_post_on_raop_at_retrieval&quot;: Number of days between requesters first post on RAOP and time of retrieval. 

  &quot;requester_number_of_comments_at_request&quot;: Total number of comments on Reddit by requester at time of request.

  &quot;requester_number_of_posts_on_raop_at_request&quot;: Total number of posts in RAOP by requester at time of request. 

  &quot;requester_number_of_posts_on_raop_at_retrieval&quot;: Total number of posts in RAOP by requester at time of retrieval.

  &quot;requester_number_of_subreddits_at_request&quot;: The number of subreddits in which the author had already posted in at the time of request.

  &quot;requester_received_pizza&quot;: Boolean indicating the success of the request, i.e., whether the requester received pizza.

  &quot;requester_user_flair&quot;: Users on RAOP receive badges (Reddit calls them flairs) which is a small picture next to their username. In our data set the user flair is either None (neither given nor received pizza, N=4282), &quot;shroom&quot; (received pizza, but not given, N=1306), or &quot;PIF&quot; (given after received, N=83).

  &quot;requester_username&quot;: Reddit username of requester.

  &quot;unix_timestamp_of_request&quot;: Unix timestamp of request (supposedly in timezone of user but in most cases equal to the UTC timestamp which is incorrect since most RAOP users are from the USA). 

  &quot;unix_timestamp_of_request_utc&quot;: Unit timestamp of request in UTC.
